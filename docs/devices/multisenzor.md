## First step
Download latest [**release**](https://github.com/GamerClassN7/Smart_Home/releases). <br>

[there will be a screenshots of release here]() <br>

## Second step
Then, unzip it (e.g. using WinRar or 7zip). You should see [some files and folders]() <br>

## Third step
Locate file named `ESP_OS_NODE_STABLE.ino`. <br>
Open it with Arduino IDE, here you will need to change [something]() <br>

[there will be a screenshot of something]() <br>

After doing that, select your ESP/NodeMCU from board list and COM ports and just click `Upload` to upload the code.

[there will be a screenshot of upload button]() <br>

## Fourth step
Connect your sensors (e.g. DHT11, LDR etc.) to your board.

After doing all above steps, you can plug-in your board and open Arduino IDE Serial Monitor to check if everything is working correctly.

**With that all done your board is ready to send data to your Smart_Home web server.** <br>
